### Research Summary
I am a Lecturer at Coventry University in the Faculty of Engineering, Environment and Computing. I teach topics in Mathematics/Statistics, Physics and Data Science. My research spans across physics and data-driven science. This includes solar and astrophysics, dynamical systems, and more recently geosciences on one hand and time-series modeling, causal inference, statistical data science and artificial intelligence on the other. I was formerly a postdoctoral researcher at the Data Assimilation Research Centre within the Department of Meteorology, University of Reading in areas of data science and physics and a guest researcher at Max-Planck-Institute fuer Kernphysik, Heidelberg. I am interested in studying dynamical processes driving physical systems varying in time. Of particular interest are observations of extreme events that occur in infrequent bursts and their relation to slower, longer term variations. A great example of such events are flares that occur in the Sun, others stars and indeed in distant galaxies. I am also interested in mathematical studies of inferring cause and effect in complex, dynamical systems. Such studies require combining mathematical discplines such as time-series modeling, causal inference using information theoretic measures, bayesian inference and modeling, with understanding physics of dynamical systems, particle transport and radiative processes.
